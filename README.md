# IMDB-Dataset-Python

IMDB is the biggest movie rating platform in the world. A significant proportion of users choose to watch movies only after checking ratings, the number of votes, and reviews of the movie on the IMDB platform. The data IMDB captures is critical to generate insights into what is the public's preference. Which genres make more money, and which genres have good ratings and still have lesser revenue?

The insights generated from the dataset can be monetized as directors can create content viewers want. Once the movie is released, this dataset can also be used to predict the movie's revenue.
